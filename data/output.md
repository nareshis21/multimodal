# Charging the Battery

Read and follow the warnings and cautions on pages viii–xi and 97–101 of this manual. Charge the battery indoors at ambient temperatures of 5 °C–35 °C (41 °F–95 °F). Do not use the battery at ambient temperatures below 0 °C/32 °F or above 40 °C/104 °F; failure to observe this precaution could damage the battery or impair its performance. Capacity may be reduced and charging times may increase at battery temperatures from 0 °C/32 °F to 15 °C/59 °F and from 45 °C/113 °F to 60 °C/140 °F. The battery will not charge if its temperature is below 0 °C (32 °F) or above 60 °C (140 °F). If the CHARGE lamp flashes quickly (about eight times a second) during charging, confirm that the temperature is in the correct range and then unplug the charger and remove and reinsert the battery. If the problem persists, cease use immediately and take battery and charger to your retailer or a Nikon-authorized service representative.

Use the charger with compatible batteries only. Unplug when not in use.

# Battery Level

Battery level is shown in the information display (if the battery is low, a warning will also be displayed in the viewfinder). If the information display does not appear when the R button is pressed, the battery is exhausted and needs to be recharged.

# Shooting in Live View Mode

Although it will not appear in the final picture, distortion may be visible in the monitor if the camera is panned horizontally or an object moves at high speed through frame. Bright light sources may leave after-images in the monitor when the camera is panned. Bright spots may also appear. Flicker and banding visible in the monitor under fluorescent, mercury vapor, or sodium lamps can be reduced using Flicker reduction (refer to page 77), although they may still be visible in the final photograph at some shutter speeds. When shooting in live view mode, avoid pointing the camera at the sun or other strong light sources. Failure to observe this precaution could result in damage to the camera’s internal circuitry.

Live view ends automatically if the mode dial is rotated to "g" or to another setting. Live view may end automatically to prevent damage to the camera’s internal circuits; exit live view when the camera is not in use. Note that the temperature of the camera’s internal circuits may rise and noise (bright spots, randomly-spaced bright pixels, or fog) may be displayed in the following instances (the camera may also become noticeably warm, but this does not indicate a malfunction):

- The ambient temperature is high
- The camera has been used for extended periods in live view or to record movies
- The camera has been used in continuous release mode for extended periods

If live view does not start when you attempt to start live view, wait for the internal circuits to cool and then try again.

# The Count Down Display

A count down will be displayed 30 seconds before live view ends automatically (the timer turns red 5 seconds before the auto off timer expires or if live view is about to end to protect the internal circuits). Depending on shooting conditions, the timer may appear immediately when live view is selected.

# Recording Movies


Flicker, banding, or distortion may be visible in the monitor and in the final movie under fluorescent, mercury vapor, or sodium lamps or if the camera is panned horizontally or an object moves at high speed through frame (flicker and banding can be reduced using Flicker reduction). Bright light sources may leave after-images when the camera is panned. Jagged edges, color fringing, moiré, and bright spots may also appear. Bright bands may appear in some areas of the frame if the subject is briefly illuminated by a flash or other bright, momentary light source. When recording movies, avoid pointing the camera at the sun or other strong light sources. Failure to observe this precaution could result in damage to the camera’s internal circuitry.

The camera can record both video and sound; do not cover the microphone during recording. Note that the built-in microphone may record lens noise during autofocus and vibration reduction. Flash lighting cannot be used during movie recording. Live view may end automatically to prevent damage to the camera’s internal circuits; exit live view when the camera is not in use. Note that the temperature of the camera’s internal circuits may rise and noise (bright spots, randomly-spaced bright pixels, or fog) may be displayed in the following instances (the camera may also become noticeably warm, but this does not indicate a malfunction):

- The ambient temperature is high
- The camera has been used for extended periods in live view or to record movies
- The camera has been used in continuous release mode for extended periods

If live view does not start when you attempt to start live view or movie recording, wait for the internal circuits to cool and then try again.

The Count-Down Display

A count down will be displayed 30 s before live view ends automatically. Depending on shooting conditions, the timer may appear immediately when movie recording begins.

# Matching Settings to the Subject or Situation (Scene Mode)


The camera offers a choice of “scene” modes. Choosing a scene mode automatically optimizes settings to suit the selected scene, making creative photography as simple as selecting a mode, framing a picture, and shooting as described on page 22.

The following scenes can be selected with the mode dial:

- Portrait: Use for portraits with soft, natural-looking skin tones. If the subject is far from the background or a telephoto lens is used, background details will be softened to lend the composition a sense of depth.
- Landscape: Use for vivid landscape shots in daylight. Note: The built-in flash and AF-assist illuminator turn off.
- Child: Use for snapshots of children. Clothing and background details are vividly rendered, while skin tones remain soft and natural.
---
# Camera Shooting Modes


Sports: Fast shutter speeds freeze motion for dynamic sports shots in which the main subject stands out clearly.

Note: The built-in flash and AF-assist illuminator turn off.

Close up: Use for close-up shots of flowers, insects, and other small objects (a macro lens can be used to focus at very close ranges).

Night Portrait: Use for a natural balance between the main subject and the background in portraits taken under low light.

# Preventing Blur

Use a tripod to prevent blur caused by camera shake at slow shutter speeds.

# Panoramas

Panorama size can be selected using the Image size item in the shooting menu; choose from Normal panorama and Wide panorama. An error message will be displayed if the camera is panned too quickly or unsteadily. Note that because panoramas are composed of multiple images, the joins between images may be visible and the desired results may not be achieved with moving subjects or with neon lights or other subjects that exhibit rapid changes in color or brightness, subjects that are too close to the camera, poorly-lit subjects, and subjects such as the sky or sea that are a solid color or contain simple repeating patterns.

Exposure compensation can be used to adjust exposure by up to ±3 EV in steps of 1/3 EV. Adjust exposure compensation after starting live view in Step 1.

The completed panorama will be slightly smaller than the area visible in the display during shooting. No panorama will be recorded if shooting ends before the halfway point; if shooting ends after the halfway point but before the panorama is complete, the unrecorded portion will be shown in gray. Dates cannot be imprinted on panoramas.

# Camera Care Guide

# Caring for the Camera

# Storage

When the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery and store it in a cool, dry area with the terminal cover in place. To prevent mold or mildew, store the camera in a dry, well-ventilated area. Do not store your camera with naphtha or camphor moth balls or in locations that:

- are poorly ventilated or subject to humidities of over 60%
- are next to equipment that produces strong electromagnetic fields, such as televisions or radios
- are exposed to temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) or below -10 °C (14 °F)

# Cleaning

Use a blower to remove dust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth. After using the camera at the beach or seaside, wipe off sand or salt with a cloth lightly dampened in distilled water and dry thoroughly. Important: Dust or other foreign matter inside the camera may cause damage not covered under warranty.

These glass elements are easily damaged. Remove dust and lint with a blower. If using an aerosol blower, keep the can vertical to prevent the discharge of liquid. To remove fingerprints and other stains, apply a small amount of lens cleaner to a soft cloth and clean with care.

Remove dust and lint with a blower. When removing fingerprints and other stains, wipe the surface lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Do not apply pressure, as this could result in damage or malfunction.

Do not use alcohol, thinner, or other volatile chemicals.

# Caring for the Camera and Battery


# Cautions

Caring for the Camera

- Do not drop: The product may malfunction if subjected to strong shocks or vibration.
- Keep dry: This product is not waterproof, and may malfunction if immersed in water or exposed to high levels of humidity. Rusting of the internal mechanism can cause irreparable damage.
- Avoid sudden changes in temperature: Sudden changes in temperature, such as those that occur when entering or leaving a heated building on a cold day, can cause condensation inside the device. To prevent condensation, place the device in a carrying case or plastic bag before exposing it to sudden changes in temperature.
- Keep away from strong magnetic fields: Do not use or store this device in the vicinity of equipment that generates strong electromagnetic radiation or magnetic fields. Strong static charges or the magnetic fields produced by equipment such as radio transmitters could interfere with the monitor, damage data stored on the memory card, or affect the product’s internal circuitry.
- Do not leave the lens pointed at the sun: Do not leave the lens pointed at the sun or other strong light source for an extended period. Intense light may cause the image sensor to deteriorate or produce a white blur effect in photographs.
- Turn the product off before removing or disconnecting the power source: Do not unplug the product or remove the battery while the product is on or while images are being recorded or deleted. Forcibly cutting power in these circumstances could result in loss of data or in damage to product memory or internal circuitry. To prevent an accidental interruption of power, avoid carrying the product from one location to another while the AC adapter is connected.

# Camera Maintenance Guide


# Cleaning

When cleaning the camera body, use a blower to gently remove dust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth. After using the camera at the beach or seaside, wipe off any sand or salt using a cloth lightly dampened in pure water and then dry the camera thoroughly.

The lens and mirror are easily damaged. Dust and lint should be gently removed with a blower. When using an aerosol blower, keep the can vertical to prevent discharge of liquid. To remove fingerprints and other stains from the lens, apply a small amount of lens cleaner to a soft cloth and wipe the lens carefully.

See the Reference Manual for information on cleaning the image sensor.

Do not touch the shutter curtain: The shutter curtain is extremely thin and easily damaged. Under no circumstances should you exert pressure on the curtain, poke it with cleaning tools, or subject it to powerful air currents from a blower. These actions could scratch, deform, or tear the curtain.

# Storage

To prevent mold or mildew, store the camera in a dry, well-ventilated area. If you are using an AC adapter, unplug the adapter to prevent fire. If the product will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery to prevent leakage and store the camera in a plastic bag containing a desiccant. Do not, however, store the camera case in a plastic bag, as this may cause the material to deteriorate. Note that desiccant gradually loses its capacity to absorb moisture and should be replaced at regular intervals.

To prevent mold or mildew, take the camera out of storage at least once a month. Turn the camera on and release the shutter a few times before putting it away.

Store the battery in a cool, dry place. Replace the terminal cover before putting the battery away.

# User Guide

# Notes on the Monitor

The monitor is constructed with extremely high precision; at least 99.99% of pixels are effective, with no more than 0.01% being missing or defective. Hence while these displays may contain pixels that are always lit (white, red, blue, or green) or always off (black), this is not a malfunction and has no effect on images recorded with the device.

Images in the monitor may be difficult to see in bright light. Do not apply pressure to the monitor, as this could cause damage or malfunction. Dust or lint on the monitor can be removed with a blower. Stains can be removed by wiping lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Should the monitor break, care should be taken to avoid injury from broken glass and to prevent liquid crystal from the monitor touching the skin or entering the eyes and mouth.

Moiré: Moiré is an interference pattern created by the interaction of an image containing a regular, repeating grid, such as the pattern of weave in cloth or windows in a building, with the camera image sensor grid. If you notice moiré in your photographs, try changing the distance to the subject, zooming in and out, or changing the angle between the subject and the camera.

# Servicing the Camera and Accessories

The camera is a precision device and requires regular servicing. Nikon recommends that the camera be inspected by the original retailer or Nikon-authorized service representative once every one to two years, and that it be serviced once every three to five years (note that fees apply to these services). Frequent inspection and servicing are particularly recommended if the camera is used professionally. Any accessories regularly used with the camera, such as lenses or optional flash units, should be included when the camera is inspected or serviced.
---
# Caring for the Battery


Batteries may leak or explode if improperly handled. Observe the following precautions when handling batteries:

- Use only batteries approved for use in this equipment.
- Do not expose the battery to flame or excessive heat.
- Keep the battery terminals clean.
- Turn the product off before replacing the battery.
- Remove the battery from the camera or charger when not in use and replace the terminal cover. These devices draw minute amounts of charge even when off and could draw the battery down to the point that it will no longer function. If the battery will not be used for some time, insert it in the camera and run it flat before removing it and storing it in a location with an ambient temperature of 15 °C to 25 °C (59 °F to 77 °F; avoid hot or extremely cold locations). Repeat this process at least once every six months.
- Turning the camera on and off repeatedly when the battery is fully discharged will shorten battery life. Batteries that have been fully discharged must be charged before use.
- The internal temperature of the battery may rise while the battery is in use. Attempting to charge the battery while the internal temperature is elevated will impair battery performance, and the battery may not charge or charge only partially. Wait for the battery to cool before charging.
- Continuing to charge the battery after it is fully charged can impair battery performance.
---
# Battery Usage Guide


A marked drop in the time a fully charged battery retains its charge when used at room temperature indicates that it requires replacement. Purchase a new EN-EL14a battery.

Charge the battery before use. When taking photographs on important occasions, ready a spare EN-EL14a battery and keep it fully charged. Depending on your location, it may be difficult to purchase replacement batteries on short notice. Note that on cold days, the capacity of batteries tends to decrease. Be sure the battery is fully charged before taking photographs outside in cold weather. Keep a spare battery in a warm place and exchange the two as necessary. Once warmed, a cold battery may recover some of its charge.

Used batteries are a valuable resource; recycle in accord with local regulations.

# Shooting in Live View Mode

Although it will not appear in the final picture, distortion may be visible in the monitor if the camera is panned horizontally or an object moves at high speed through frame. Bright light sources may leave after-images in the monitor when the camera is panned. Bright spots may also appear. Flicker and banding visible in the monitor under fluorescent, mercury vapor, or sodium lamps can be reduced using Flicker reduction (refer to page 77), although they may still be visible in the final photograph at some shutter speeds. When shooting in live view mode, avoid pointing the camera at the sun or other strong light sources. Failure to observe this precaution could result in damage to the camera’s internal circuitry.

Live view ends automatically if the mode dial is rotated to "g" or to another setting. Live view may end automatically to prevent damage to the camera’s internal circuits; exit live view when the camera is not in use. Note that the temperature of the camera’s internal circuits may rise and noise (bright spots, randomly-spaced bright pixels, or fog) may be displayed in the following instances (the camera may also become noticeably warm, but this does not indicate a malfunction):

- The ambient temperature is high
- The camera has been used for extended periods in live view or to record movies
- The camera has been used in continuous release mode for extended periods

If live view does not start when you attempt to start live view, wait for the internal circuits to cool and then try again.

# The Count Down Display

A count down will be displayed 30 seconds before live view ends automatically (the timer turns red 5 seconds before the auto off timer expires or if live view is about to end to protect the internal circuits). Depending on shooting conditions, the timer may appear immediately when live view is selected.

# Recording Movies


Flicker, banding, or distortion may be visible in the monitor and in the final movie under fluorescent, mercury vapor, or sodium lamps or if the camera is panned horizontally or an object moves at high speed through frame (flicker and banding can be reduced using Flicker reduction). Bright light sources may leave after-images when the camera is panned. Jagged edges, color fringing, moiré, and bright spots may also appear. Bright bands may appear in some areas of the frame if the subject is briefly illuminated by a flash or other bright, momentary light source. When recording movies, avoid pointing the camera at the sun or other strong light sources. Failure to observe this precaution could result in damage to the camera’s internal circuitry.

The camera can record both video and sound; do not cover the microphone during recording. Note that the built-in microphone may record lens noise during autofocus and vibration reduction. Flash lighting cannot be used during movie recording. Live view may end automatically to prevent damage to the camera’s internal circuits; exit live view when the camera is not in use. Note that the temperature of the camera’s internal circuits may rise and noise (bright spots, randomly-spaced bright pixels, or fog) may be displayed in the following instances (the camera may also become noticeably warm, but this does not indicate a malfunction):

- The ambient temperature is high
- The camera has been used for extended periods in live view or to record movies
- The camera has been used in continuous release mode for extended periods

If live view does not start when you attempt to start live view or movie recording, wait for the internal circuits to cool and then try again.

# Matching Settings to the Subject or Situation (Scene Mode)


The camera offers a choice of “scene” modes. Choosing a scene mode automatically optimizes settings to suit the selected scene, making creative photography as simple as selecting a mode, framing a picture, and shooting as described on page 22.

The following scenes can be selected with the mode dial:

- Portrait: Use for portraits with soft, natural-looking skin tones. If the subject is far from the background or a telephoto lens is used, background details will be softened to lend the composition a sense of depth.
- Landscape: Use for vivid landscape shots in daylight. Note: The built-in flash and AF-assist illuminator turn off.
- Child: Use for snapshots of children. Clothing and background details are vividly rendered, while skin tones remain soft and natural.
---
# Camera Shooting Modes


Sports: Fast shutter speeds freeze motion for dynamic sports shots in which the main subject stands out clearly.

Note: The built-in flash and AF-assist illuminator turn off.

Close up: Use for close-up shots of flowers, insects, and other small objects (a macro lens can be used to focus at very close ranges).

Night Portrait: Use for a natural balance between the main subject and the background in portraits taken under low light.

# Preventing Blur

Use a tripod to prevent blur caused by camera shake at slow shutter speeds.

# Panoramas

Panorama size can be selected using the Image size item in the shooting menu; choose from Normal panorama and Wide panorama. An error message will be displayed if the camera is panned too quickly or unsteadily. Note that because panoramas are composed of multiple images, the joins between images may be visible and the desired results may not be achieved with moving subjects or with neon lights or other subjects that exhibit rapid changes in color or brightness, subjects that are too close to the camera, poorly-lit subjects, and subjects such as the sky or sea that are a solid color or contain simple repeating patterns.

Exposure compensation can be used to adjust exposure by up to ±3 EV in steps of 1/3 EV. Adjust exposure compensation after starting live view in Step 1.

The completed panorama will be slightly smaller than the area visible in the display during shooting. No panorama will be recorded if shooting ends before the halfway point; if shooting ends after the halfway point but before the panorama is complete, the unrecorded portion will be shown in gray. Dates cannot be imprinted on panoramas.

# Camera Care Guide

# Caring for the Camera

# Storage

When the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery and store it in a cool, dry area with the terminal cover in place. To prevent mold or mildew, store the camera in a dry, well-ventilated area. Do not store your camera with naphtha or camphor moth balls or in locations that:

- are poorly ventilated or subject to humidities of over 60%
- are next to equipment that produces strong electromagnetic fields, such as televisions or radios
- are exposed to temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) or below -10 °C (14 °F)

# Cleaning

Use a blower to remove dust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth. After using the camera at the beach or seaside, wipe off sand or salt with a cloth lightly dampened in distilled water and dry thoroughly. Important: Dust or other foreign matter inside the camera may cause damage not covered under warranty.

These glass elements are easily damaged. Remove dust and lint with a blower. If using an aerosol blower, keep the can vertical to prevent the discharge of liquid. To remove fingerprints and other stains, apply a small amount of lens cleaner to a soft cloth and clean with care.

Remove dust and lint with a blower. When removing fingerprints and other stains, wipe the surface lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Do not apply pressure, as this could result in damage or malfunction.

Do not use alcohol, thinner, or other volatile chemicals.

# Caring for the Camera and Battery


# Cautions

Caring for the Camera

- Do not drop: The product may malfunction if subjected to strong shocks or vibration.
- Keep dry: This product is not waterproof, and may malfunction if immersed in water or exposed to high levels of humidity. Rusting of the internal mechanism can cause irreparable damage.
- Avoid sudden changes in temperature: Sudden changes in temperature, such as those that occur when entering or leaving a heated building on a cold day, can cause condensation inside the device. To prevent condensation, place the device in a carrying case or plastic bag before exposing it to sudden changes in temperature.
- Keep away from strong magnetic fields: Do not use or store this device in the vicinity of equipment that generates strong electromagnetic radiation or magnetic fields. Strong static charges or the magnetic fields produced by equipment such as radio transmitters could interfere with the monitor, damage data stored on the memory card, or affect the product’s internal circuitry.
- Do not leave the lens pointed at the sun: Do not leave the lens pointed at the sun or other strong light source for an extended period. Intense light may cause the image sensor to deteriorate or produce a white blur effect in photographs.
- Turn the product off before removing or disconnecting the power source: Do not unplug the product or remove the battery while the product is on or while images are being recorded or deleted. Forcibly cutting power in these circumstances could result in loss of data or in damage to product memory or internal circuitry. To prevent an accidental interruption of power, avoid carrying the product from one location to another while the AC adapter is connected.
---
# Camera Maintenance Guide


# Cleaning

When cleaning the camera body, use a blower to gently remove dust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth. After using the camera at the beach or seaside, wipe off any sand or salt using a cloth lightly dampened in pure water and then dry the camera thoroughly.

The lens and mirror are easily damaged. Dust and lint should be gently removed with a blower. When using an aerosol blower, keep the can vertical to prevent discharge of liquid. To remove fingerprints and other stains from the lens, apply a small amount of lens cleaner to a soft cloth and wipe the lens carefully.

See the Reference Manual for information on cleaning the image sensor.

Do not touch the shutter curtain: The shutter curtain is extremely thin and easily damaged. Under no circumstances should you exert pressure on the curtain, poke it with cleaning tools, or subject it to powerful air currents from a blower. These actions could scratch, deform, or tear the curtain.

# Storage

To prevent mold or mildew, store the camera in a dry, well-ventilated area. If you are using an AC adapter, unplug the adapter to prevent fire. If the product will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery to prevent leakage and store the camera in a plastic bag containing a desiccant. Do not, however, store the camera case in a plastic bag, as this may cause the material to deteriorate. Note that desiccant gradually loses its capacity to absorb moisture and should be replaced at regular intervals.

To prevent mold or mildew, take the camera out of storage at least once a month. Turn the camera on and release the shutter a few times before putting it away.

Store the battery in a cool, dry place. Replace the terminal cover before putting the battery away.
---
# User Guide

# Notes on the Monitor

The monitor is constructed with extremely high precision; at least 99.99% of pixels are effective, with no more than 0.01% being missing or defective. Hence while these displays may contain pixels that are always lit (white, red, blue, or green) or always off (black), this is not a malfunction and has no effect on images recorded with the device.

Images in the monitor may be difficult to see in bright light. Do not apply pressure to the monitor, as this could cause damage or malfunction. Dust or lint on the monitor can be removed with a blower. Stains can be removed by wiping lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Should the monitor break, care should be taken to avoid injury from broken glass and to prevent liquid crystal from the monitor touching the skin or entering the eyes and mouth.

Moiré: Moiré is an interference pattern created by the interaction of an image containing a regular, repeating grid, such as the pattern of weave in cloth or windows in a building, with the camera image sensor grid. If you notice moiré in your photographs, try changing the distance to the subject, zooming in and out, or changing the angle between the subject and the camera.

# Servicing the Camera and Accessories

The camera is a precision device and requires regular servicing. Nikon recommends that the camera be inspected by the original retailer or Nikon-authorized service representative once every one to two years, and that it be serviced once every three to five years (note that fees apply to these services). Frequent inspection and servicing are particularly recommended if the camera is used professionally. Any accessories regularly used with the camera, such as lenses or optional flash units, should be included when the camera is inspected or serviced.

# Caring for the Battery


Batteries may leak or explode if improperly handled. Observe the following precautions when handling batteries:

- Use only batteries approved for use in this equipment.
- Do not expose the battery to flame or excessive heat.
- Keep the battery terminals clean.
- Turn the product off before replacing the battery.
- Remove the battery from the camera or charger when not in use and replace the terminal cover. These devices draw minute amounts of charge even when off and could draw the battery down to the point that it will no longer function. If the battery will not be used for some time, insert it in the camera and run it flat before removing it and storing it in a location with an ambient temperature of 15 °C to 25 °C (59 °F to 77 °F; avoid hot or extremely cold locations). Repeat this process at least once every six months.
- Turning the camera on and off repeatedly when the battery is fully discharged will shorten battery life. Batteries that have been fully discharged must be charged before use.
- The internal temperature of the battery may rise while the battery is in use. Attempting to charge the battery while the internal temperature is elevated will impair battery performance, and the battery may not charge or charge only partially. Wait for the battery to cool before charging.
- Continuing to charge the battery after it is fully charged can impair battery performance.
---
# Battery Usage Guide


A marked drop in the time a fully charged battery retains its charge when used at room temperature indicates that it requires replacement. Purchase a new EN-EL14a battery.

Charge the battery before use. When taking photographs on important occasions, ready a spare EN-EL14a battery and keep it fully charged. Depending on your location, it may be difficult to purchase replacement batteries on short notice. Note that on cold days, the capacity of batteries tends to decrease. Be sure the battery is fully charged before taking photographs outside in cold weather. Keep a spare battery in a warm place and exchange the two as necessary. Once warmed, a cold battery may recover some of its charge.

Used batteries are a valuable resource; recycle in accord with local regulations.

# Charging the Battery

Read and follow the warnings and cautions on pages viii–xi and 97–101 of this manual. Charge the battery indoors at ambient temperatures of 5 °C–35 °C (41 °F–95 °F). Do not use the battery at ambient temperatures below 0 °C/32 °F or above 40 °C/104 °F; failure to observe this precaution could damage the battery or impair its performance. Capacity may be reduced and charging times may increase at battery temperatures from 0 °C/32 °F to 15 °C/59 °F and from 45 °C/113 °F to 60 °C/140 °F. The battery will not charge if its temperature is below 0 °C (32 °F) or above 60 °C (140 °F). If the CHARGE lamp flashes quickly (about eight times a second) during charging, confirm that the temperature is in the correct range and then unplug the charger and remove and reinsert the battery. If the problem persists, cease use immediately and take battery and charger to your retailer or a Nikon-authorized service representative.

Use the charger with compatible batteries only. Unplug when not in use.

# Battery Level

Battery level is shown in the information display (if the battery is low, a warning will also be displayed in the viewfinder). If the information display does not appear when the R button is pressed, the battery is exhausted and needs to be recharged.

# Shooting in Live View Mode

Although it will not appear in the final picture, distortion may be visible in the monitor if the camera is panned horizontally or an object moves at high speed through frame. Bright light sources may leave after-images in the monitor when the camera is panned. Bright spots may also appear. Flicker and banding visible in the monitor under fluorescent, mercury vapor, or sodium lamps can be reduced using Flicker reduction (refer to page 77), although they may still be visible in the final photograph at some shutter speeds. When shooting in live view mode, avoid pointing the camera at the sun or other strong light sources. Failure to observe this precaution could result in damage to the camera’s internal circuitry.

Live view ends automatically if the mode dial is rotated to "g" or to another setting. Live view may end automatically to prevent damage to the camera’s internal circuits; exit live view when the camera is not in use. Note that the temperature of the camera’s internal circuits may rise and noise (bright spots, randomly-spaced bright pixels, or fog) may be displayed in the following instances (the camera may also become noticeably warm, but this does not indicate a malfunction):

- The ambient temperature is high
- The camera has been used for extended periods in live view or to record movies
- The camera has been used in continuous release mode for extended periods

If live view does not start when you attempt to start live view, wait for the internal circuits to cool and then try again.

# The Count Down Display

A count down will be displayed 30 seconds before live view ends automatically (the timer turns red 5 seconds before the auto off timer expires or if live view is about to end to protect the internal circuits). Depending on shooting conditions, the timer may appear immediately when live view is selected.

# Recording Movies


Flicker, banding, or distortion may be visible in the monitor and in the final movie under fluorescent, mercury vapor, or sodium lamps or if the camera is panned horizontally or an object moves at high speed through frame (flicker and banding can be reduced using Flicker reduction). Bright light sources may leave after-images when the camera is panned. Jagged edges, color fringing, moiré, and bright spots may also appear. Bright bands may appear in some areas of the frame if the subject is briefly illuminated by a flash or other bright, momentary light source. When recording movies, avoid pointing the camera at the sun or other strong light sources. Failure to observe this precaution could result in damage to the camera’s internal circuitry.

The camera can record both video and sound; do not cover the microphone during recording. Note that the built-in microphone may record lens noise during autofocus and vibration reduction. Flash lighting cannot be used during movie recording. Live view may end automatically to prevent damage to the camera’s internal circuits; exit live view when the camera is not in use. Note that the temperature of the camera’s internal circuits may rise and noise (bright spots, randomly-spaced bright pixels, or fog) may be displayed in the following instances (the camera may also become noticeably warm, but this does not indicate a malfunction):

- The ambient temperature is high
- The camera has been used for extended periods in live view or to record movies
- The camera has been used in continuous release mode for extended periods

If live view does not start when you attempt to start live view or movie recording, wait for the internal circuits to cool and then try again.

# Matching Settings to the Subject or Situation (Scene Mode)


The camera offers a choice of “scene” modes. Choosing a scene mode automatically optimizes settings to suit the selected scene, making creative photography as simple as selecting a mode, framing a picture, and shooting as described on page 22.

The following scenes can be selected with the mode dial:

- Portrait: Use for portraits with soft, natural-looking skin tones. If the subject is far from the background or a telephoto lens is used, background details will be softened to lend the composition a sense of depth.
- Landscape: Use for vivid landscape shots in daylight. Note: The built-in flash and AF-assist illuminator turn off.
- Child: Use for snapshots of children. Clothing and background details are vividly rendered, while skin tones remain soft and natural.
---
# Camera Shooting Modes


Sports: Fast shutter speeds freeze motion for dynamic sports shots in which the main subject stands out clearly.

Note: The built-in flash and AF-assist illuminator turn off.

Close up: Use for close-up shots of flowers, insects, and other small objects (a macro lens can be used to focus at very close ranges).

Night Portrait: Use for a natural balance between the main subject and the background in portraits taken under low light.

# Preventing Blur

Use a tripod to prevent blur caused by camera shake at slow shutter speeds.

# Panoramas

Panorama size can be selected using the Image size item in the shooting menu; choose from Normal panorama and Wide panorama. An error message will be displayed if the camera is panned too quickly or unsteadily. Note that because panoramas are composed of multiple images, the joins between images may be visible and the desired results may not be achieved with moving subjects or with neon lights or other subjects that exhibit rapid changes in color or brightness, subjects that are too close to the camera, poorly-lit subjects, and subjects such as the sky or sea that are a solid color or contain simple repeating patterns.

Exposure compensation can be used to adjust exposure by up to ±3 EV in steps of 1/3 EV. Adjust exposure compensation after starting live view in Step 1.

The completed panorama will be slightly smaller than the area visible in the display during shooting. No panorama will be recorded if shooting ends before the halfway point; if shooting ends after the halfway point but before the panorama is complete, the unrecorded portion will be shown in gray. Dates cannot be imprinted on panoramas.

# Camera Care Guide

# Caring for the Camera

# Storage

When the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery and store it in a cool, dry area with the terminal cover in place. To prevent mold or mildew, store the camera in a dry, well-ventilated area. Do not store your camera with naphtha or camphor moth balls or in locations that:

- are poorly ventilated or subject to humidities of over 60%
- are next to equipment that produces strong electromagnetic fields, such as televisions or radios
- are exposed to temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) or below -10 °C (14 °F)

# Cleaning

Use a blower to remove dust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth. After using the camera at the beach or seaside, wipe off sand or salt with a cloth lightly dampened in distilled water and dry thoroughly. Important: Dust or other foreign matter inside the camera may cause damage not covered under warranty.

These glass elements are easily damaged. Remove dust and lint with a blower. If using an aerosol blower, keep the can vertical to prevent the discharge of liquid. To remove fingerprints and other stains, apply a small amount of lens cleaner to a soft cloth and clean with care.

Remove dust and lint with a blower. When removing fingerprints and other stains, wipe the surface lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Do not apply pressure, as this could result in damage or malfunction.

Do not use alcohol, thinner, or other volatile chemicals.

# Caring for the Camera and Battery


# Cautions

Caring for the Camera

- Do not drop: The product may malfunction if subjected to strong shocks or vibration.
- Keep dry: This product is not waterproof, and may malfunction if immersed in water or exposed to high levels of humidity. Rusting of the internal mechanism can cause irreparable damage.
- Avoid sudden changes in temperature: Sudden changes in temperature, such as those that occur when entering or leaving a heated building on a cold day, can cause condensation inside the device. To prevent condensation, place the device in a carrying case or plastic bag before exposing it to sudden changes in temperature.
- Keep away from strong magnetic fields: Do not use or store this device in the vicinity of equipment that generates strong electromagnetic radiation or magnetic fields. Strong static charges or the magnetic fields produced by equipment such as radio transmitters could interfere with the monitor, damage data stored on the memory card, or affect the product’s internal circuitry.
- Do not leave the lens pointed at the sun: Do not leave the lens pointed at the sun or other strong light source for an extended period. Intense light may cause the image sensor to deteriorate or produce a white blur effect in photographs.
- Turn the product off before removing or disconnecting the power source: Do not unplug the product or remove the battery while the product is on or while images are being recorded or deleted. Forcibly cutting power in these circumstances could result in loss of data or in damage to product memory or internal circuitry. To prevent an accidental interruption of power, avoid carrying the product from one location to another while the AC adapter is connected.

# Camera Maintenance Guide


# Cleaning

When cleaning the camera body, use a blower to gently remove dust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth. After using the camera at the beach or seaside, wipe off any sand or salt using a cloth lightly dampened in pure water and then dry the camera thoroughly.

The lens and mirror are easily damaged. Dust and lint should be gently removed with a blower. When using an aerosol blower, keep the can vertical to prevent discharge of liquid. To remove fingerprints and other stains from the lens, apply a small amount of lens cleaner to a soft cloth and wipe the lens carefully.

See the Reference Manual for information on cleaning the image sensor.

Do not touch the shutter curtain: The shutter curtain is extremely thin and easily damaged. Under no circumstances should you exert pressure on the curtain, poke it with cleaning tools, or subject it to powerful air currents from a blower. These actions could scratch, deform, or tear the curtain.

# Storage

To prevent mold or mildew, store the camera in a dry, well-ventilated area. If you are using an AC adapter, unplug the adapter to prevent fire. If the product will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery to prevent leakage and store the camera in a plastic bag containing a desiccant. Do not, however, store the camera case in a plastic bag, as this may cause the material to deteriorate. Note that desiccant gradually loses its capacity to absorb moisture and should be replaced at regular intervals.

To prevent mold or mildew, take the camera out of storage at least once a month. Turn the camera on and release the shutter a few times before putting it away.

Store the battery in a cool, dry place. Replace the terminal cover before putting the battery away.

# User Guide

# Notes on the Monitor

The monitor is constructed with extremely high precision; at least 99.99% of pixels are effective, with no more than 0.01% being missing or defective. Hence while these displays may contain pixels that are always lit (white, red, blue, or green) or always off (black), this is not a malfunction and has no effect on images recorded with the device.

Images in the monitor may be difficult to see in bright light. Do not apply pressure to the monitor, as this could cause damage or malfunction. Dust or lint on the monitor can be removed with a blower. Stains can be removed by wiping lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Should the monitor break, care should be taken to avoid injury from broken glass and to prevent liquid crystal from the monitor touching the skin or entering the eyes and mouth.

Moiré: Moiré is an interference pattern created by the interaction of an image containing a regular, repeating grid, such as the pattern of weave in cloth or windows in a building, with the camera image sensor grid. If you notice moiré in your photographs, try changing the distance to the subject, zooming in and out, or changing the angle between the subject and the camera.

# Servicing the Camera and Accessories

The camera is a precision device and requires regular servicing. Nikon recommends that the camera be inspected by the original retailer or Nikon-authorized service representative once every one to two years, and that it be serviced once every three to five years (note that fees apply to these services). Frequent inspection and servicing are particularly recommended if the camera is used professionally. Any accessories regularly used with the camera, such as lenses or optional flash units, should be included when the camera is inspected or serviced.
---
# Caring for the Battery


Batteries may leak or explode if improperly handled. Observe the following precautions when handling batteries:

- Use only batteries approved for use in this equipment.
- Do not expose the battery to flame or excessive heat.
- Keep the battery terminals clean.
- Turn the product off before replacing the battery.
- Remove the battery from the camera or charger when not in use and replace the terminal cover. These devices draw minute amounts of charge even when off and could draw the battery down to the point that it will no longer function. If the battery will not be used for some time, insert it in the camera and run it flat before removing it and storing it in a location with an ambient temperature of 15 °C to 25 °C (59 °F to 77 °F; avoid hot or extremely cold locations). Repeat this process at least once every six months.
- Turning the camera on and off repeatedly when the battery is fully discharged will shorten battery life. Batteries that have been fully discharged must be charged before use.
- The internal temperature of the battery may rise while the battery is in use. Attempting to charge the battery while the internal temperature is elevated will impair battery performance, and the battery may not charge or charge only partially. Wait for the battery to cool before charging.
- Continuing to charge the battery after it is fully charged can impair battery performance.
---
# Battery Usage Guide


A marked drop in the time a fully charged battery retains its charge when used at room temperature indicates that it requires replacement. Purchase a new EN-EL14a battery.

Charge the battery before use. When taking photographs on important occasions, ready a spare EN-EL14a battery and keep it fully charged. Depending on your location, it may be difficult to purchase replacement batteries on short notice. Note that on cold days, the capacity of batteries tends to decrease. Be sure the battery is fully charged before taking photographs outside in cold weather. Keep a spare battery in a warm place and exchange the two as necessary. Once warmed, a cold battery may recover some of its charge.

Used batteries are a valuable resource; recycle in accord with local regulations.

# Shooting in Live View Mode

Although it will not appear in the final picture, distortion may be visible in the monitor if the camera is panned horizontally or an object moves at high speed through frame. Bright light sources may leave after-images in the monitor when the camera is panned. Bright spots may also appear. Flicker and banding visible in the monitor under fluorescent, mercury vapor, or sodium lamps can be reduced using Flicker reduction (refer to page 77), although they may still be visible in the final photograph at some shutter speeds. When shooting in live view mode, avoid pointing the camera at the sun or other strong light sources. Failure to observe this precaution could result in damage to the camera’s internal circuitry.

Live view ends automatically if the mode dial is rotated to "g" or to another setting. Live view may end automatically to prevent damage to the camera’s internal circuits; exit live view when the camera is not in use. Note that the temperature of the camera’s internal circuits may rise and noise (bright spots, randomly-spaced bright pixels, or fog) may be displayed in the following instances (the camera may also become noticeably warm, but this does not indicate a malfunction):

- The ambient temperature is high
- The camera has been used for extended periods in live view or to record movies
- The camera has been used in continuous release mode for extended periods

If live view does not start when you attempt to start live view, wait for the internal circuits to cool and then try again.

# The Count Down Display

A count down will be displayed 30 seconds before live view ends automatically (the timer turns red 5 seconds before the auto off timer expires or if live view is about to end to protect the internal circuits). Depending on shooting conditions, the timer may appear immediately when live view is selected.

# Recording Movies


Flicker, banding, or distortion may be visible in the monitor and in the final movie under fluorescent, mercury vapor, or sodium lamps or if the camera is panned horizontally or an object moves at high speed through frame (flicker and banding can be reduced using Flicker reduction). Bright light sources may leave after-images when the camera is panned. Jagged edges, color fringing, moiré, and bright spots may also appear. Bright bands may appear in some areas of the frame if the subject is briefly illuminated by a flash or other bright, momentary light source. When recording movies, avoid pointing the camera at the sun or other strong light sources. Failure to observe this precaution could result in damage to the camera’s internal circuitry.

The camera can record both video and sound; do not cover the microphone during recording. Note that the built-in microphone may record lens noise during autofocus and vibration reduction. Flash lighting cannot be used during movie recording. Live view may end automatically to prevent damage to the camera’s internal circuits; exit live view when the camera is not in use. Note that the temperature of the camera’s internal circuits may rise and noise (bright spots, randomly-spaced bright pixels, or fog) may be displayed in the following instances (the camera may also become noticeably warm, but this does not indicate a malfunction):

- The ambient temperature is high
- The camera has been used for extended periods in live view or to record movies
- The camera has been used in continuous release mode for extended periods

If live view does not start when you attempt to start live view or movie recording, wait for the internal circuits to cool and then try again.

# Matching Settings to the Subject or Situation (Scene Mode)


The camera offers a choice of “scene” modes. Choosing a scene mode automatically optimizes settings to suit the selected scene, making creative photography as simple as selecting a mode, framing a picture, and shooting as described on page 22.

The following scenes can be selected with the mode dial:

- Portrait: Use for portraits with soft, natural-looking skin tones. If the subject is far from the background or a telephoto lens is used, background details will be softened to lend the composition a sense of depth.
- Landscape: Use for vivid landscape shots in daylight. Note: The built-in flash and AF-assist illuminator turn off.
- Child: Use for snapshots of children. Clothing and background details are vividly rendered, while skin tones remain soft and natural.
---
# Camera Shooting Modes


Sports: Fast shutter speeds freeze motion for dynamic sports shots in which the main subject stands out clearly.

Note: The built-in flash and AF-assist illuminator turn off.

Close up: Use for close-up shots of flowers, insects, and other small objects (a macro lens can be used to focus at very close ranges).

Night Portrait: Use for a natural balance between the main subject and the background in portraits taken under low light.

# Preventing Blur

Use a tripod to prevent blur caused by camera shake at slow shutter speeds.

# Panoramas

Panorama size can be selected using the Image size item in the shooting menu; choose from Normal panorama and Wide panorama. An error message will be displayed if the camera is panned too quickly or unsteadily. Note that because panoramas are composed of multiple images, the joins between images may be visible and the desired results may not be achieved with moving subjects or with neon lights or other subjects that exhibit rapid changes in color or brightness, subjects that are too close to the camera, poorly-lit subjects, and subjects such as the sky or sea that are a solid color or contain simple repeating patterns.

Exposure compensation can be used to adjust exposure by up to ±3 EV in steps of 1/3 EV. Adjust exposure compensation after starting live view in Step 1.

The completed panorama will be slightly smaller than the area visible in the display during shooting. No panorama will be recorded if shooting ends before the halfway point; if shooting ends after the halfway point but before the panorama is complete, the unrecorded portion will be shown in gray. Dates cannot be imprinted on panoramas.

# Camera Care Guide

# Caring for the Camera

# Storage

When the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery and store it in a cool, dry area with the terminal cover in place. To prevent mold or mildew, store the camera in a dry, well-ventilated area. Do not store your camera with naphtha or camphor moth balls or in locations that:

- are poorly ventilated or subject to humidities of over 60%
- are next to equipment that produces strong electromagnetic fields, such as televisions or radios
- are exposed to temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) or below -10 °C (14 °F)

# Cleaning

Use a blower to remove dust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth. After using the camera at the beach or seaside, wipe off sand or salt with a cloth lightly dampened in distilled water and dry thoroughly. Important: Dust or other foreign matter inside the camera may cause damage not covered under warranty.

These glass elements are easily damaged. Remove dust and lint with a blower. If using an aerosol blower, keep the can vertical to prevent the discharge of liquid. To remove fingerprints and other stains, apply a small amount of lens cleaner to a soft cloth and clean with care.

Remove dust and lint with a blower. When removing fingerprints and other stains, wipe the surface lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Do not apply pressure, as this could result in damage or malfunction.

Do not use alcohol, thinner, or other volatile chemicals.

# Caring for the Camera and Battery


# Cautions

Caring for the Camera

- Do not drop: The product may malfunction if subjected to strong shocks or vibration.
- Keep dry: This product is not waterproof, and may malfunction if immersed in water or exposed to high levels of humidity. Rusting of the internal mechanism can cause irreparable damage.
- Avoid sudden changes in temperature: Sudden changes in temperature, such as those that occur when entering or leaving a heated building on a cold day, can cause condensation inside the device. To prevent condensation, place the device in a carrying case or plastic bag before exposing it to sudden changes in temperature.
- Keep away from strong magnetic fields: Do not use or store this device in the vicinity of equipment that generates strong electromagnetic radiation or magnetic fields. Strong static charges or the magnetic fields produced by equipment such as radio transmitters could interfere with the monitor, damage data stored on the memory card, or affect the product’s internal circuitry.
- Do not leave the lens pointed at the sun: Do not leave the lens pointed at the sun or other strong light source for an extended period. Intense light may cause the image sensor to deteriorate or produce a white blur effect in photographs.
- Turn the product off before removing or disconnecting the power source: Do not unplug the product or remove the battery while the product is on or while images are being recorded or deleted. Forcibly cutting power in these circumstances could result in loss of data or in damage to product memory or internal circuitry. To prevent an accidental interruption of power, avoid carrying the product from one location to another while the AC adapter is connected.

# Camera Maintenance Guide


# Cleaning

When cleaning the camera body, use a blower to gently remove dust and lint, then wipe gently with a soft, dry cloth. After using the camera at the beach or seaside, wipe off any sand or salt using a cloth lightly dampened in pure water and then dry the camera thoroughly.

The lens and mirror are easily damaged. Dust and lint should be gently removed with a blower. When using an aerosol blower, keep the can vertical to prevent discharge of liquid. To remove fingerprints and other stains from the lens, apply a small amount of lens cleaner to a soft cloth and wipe the lens carefully.

See the Reference Manual for information on cleaning the image sensor.

Do not touch the shutter curtain: The shutter curtain is extremely thin and easily damaged. Under no circumstances should you exert pressure on the curtain, poke it with cleaning tools, or subject it to powerful air currents from a blower. These actions could scratch, deform, or tear the curtain.

# Storage

To prevent mold or mildew, store the camera in a dry, well-ventilated area. If you are using an AC adapter, unplug the adapter to prevent fire. If the product will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery to prevent leakage and store the camera in a plastic bag containing a desiccant. Do not, however, store the camera case in a plastic bag, as this may cause the material to deteriorate. Note that desiccant gradually loses its capacity to absorb moisture and should be replaced at regular intervals.

To prevent mold or mildew, take the camera out of storage at least once a month. Turn the camera on and release the shutter a few times before putting it away.

Store the battery in a cool, dry place. Replace the terminal cover before putting the battery away.

# User Guide

# Notes on the Monitor

The monitor is constructed with extremely high precision; at least 99.99% of pixels are effective, with no more than 0.01% being missing or defective. Hence while these displays may contain pixels that are always lit (white, red, blue, or green) or always off (black), this is not a malfunction and has no effect on images recorded with the device.

Images in the monitor may be difficult to see in bright light. Do not apply pressure to the monitor, as this could cause damage or malfunction. Dust or lint on the monitor can be removed with a blower. Stains can be removed by wiping lightly with a soft cloth or chamois leather. Should the monitor break, care should be taken to avoid injury from broken glass and to prevent liquid crystal from the monitor touching the skin or entering the eyes and mouth.

Moiré: Moiré is an interference pattern created by the interaction of an image containing a regular, repeating grid, such as the pattern of weave in cloth or windows in a building, with the camera image sensor grid. If you notice moiré in your photographs, try changing the distance to the subject, zooming in and out, or changing the angle between the subject and the camera.

# Servicing the Camera and Accessories

The camera is a precision device and requires regular servicing. Nikon recommends that the camera be inspected by the original retailer or Nikon-authorized service representative once every one to two years, and that it be serviced once every three to five years (note that fees apply to these services). Frequent inspection and servicing are particularly recommended if the camera is used professionally. Any accessories regularly used with the camera, such as lenses or optional flash units, should be included when the camera is inspected or serviced.

# Caring for the Battery


Batteries may leak or explode if improperly handled. Observe the following precautions when handling batteries:

- Use only batteries approved for use in this equipment.
- Do not expose the battery to flame or excessive heat.
- Keep the battery terminals clean.
- Turn the product off before replacing the battery.
- Remove the battery from the camera or charger when not in use and replace the terminal cover. These devices draw minute amounts of charge even when off and could draw the battery down to the point that it will no longer function. If the battery will not be used for some time, insert it in the camera and run it flat before removing it and storing it in a location with an ambient temperature of 15 °C to 25 °C (59 °F to 77 °F; avoid hot or extremely cold locations). Repeat this process at least once every six months.
- Turning the camera on and off repeatedly when the battery is fully discharged will shorten battery life. Batteries that have been fully discharged must be charged before use.
- The internal temperature of the battery may rise while the battery is in use. Attempting to charge the battery while the internal temperature is elevated will impair battery performance, and the battery may not charge or charge only partially. Wait for the battery to cool before charging.
- Continuing to charge the battery after it is fully charged can impair battery performance.
---
# Battery Usage Guide


A marked drop in the time a fully charged battery retains its charge when used at room temperature indicates that it requires replacement. Purchase a new EN-EL14a battery.

Charge the battery before use. When taking photographs on important occasions, ready a spare EN-EL14a battery and keep it fully charged. Depending on your location, it may be difficult to purchase replacement batteries on short notice. Note that on cold days, the capacity of batteries tends to decrease. Be sure the battery is fully charged before taking photographs outside in cold weather. Keep a spare battery in a warm place and exchange the two as necessary. Once warmed, a cold battery may recover some of its charge.

Used batteries are a valuable resource; recycle in accord with local regulations.

To ensure optimal performance from rechargeable Nikon EN-EL14a batteries, follow these tips:

- Keep the battery contacts clean. Soiled contacts can reduce battery performance.
- Use batteries immediately after charging. Batteries will lose their charge if left unused.

By following these guidelines, you can maximize the battery life of your Nikon camera and enjoy extended usage.
